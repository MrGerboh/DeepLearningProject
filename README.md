Neural inverted index for fast and effective information retrieval.

Information retrieval (IR) systems are designed to provide a ranked list of pertinent documents in response to user queries. Most contemporary information retrieval systems adopt the index-then-retrieve pipeline. Recently, an alternative approach called the Differentiable Search Index (DSI) has been proposed. Instead of segregating indexing and retrieval into two distinct components in an IR system, DSI aims to encompass all corpus information and execute retrieval within a single Transformer language model.
